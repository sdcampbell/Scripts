## b64_encode_image.py

Base 64 encodes a jpg or png image file and outputs to the clipboard the image tag to embed in HTML. I use this to make it easy to create blog posts without having to worry about where I save my image and the path, and by embedding the image in the page I don't have to worry about deleting the image when I delete the post.

## str2hex.py

str2hex.py is a module that converts a hex address string such as "0x7fff61fe5d54" to a hex value 0x7fff61fe5d54.
