## b64_encode_image.py

Base 64 encodes a jpg or png image file and outputs to the clipboard the image tag to embed in HTML. I use this to make it easy to create blog posts without having to worry about where I save my image and the path, and by embedding the image in the page I don't have to worry about deleting the image when I delete the post.
